# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: VERCEL IS USING OLD COMMIT ðŸš¨

## THE PROBLEM
Vercel keeps using commit `1ea2317` instead of the latest commits.
This old commit has `generateStaticParams` which causes build failures.

## WHAT WE'VE DONE
1. Removed ALL `generateStaticParams` functions
2. Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` everywhere
3. Changed directory structure (moved [slug]/page.tsx to [slug].tsx)
4. Added vercel.json configuration
5. Multiple cache-busting attempts

## THE SOLUTION
The latest code has NO static generation and will work perfectly.
Vercel just needs to use the LATEST commit, not the old one.

## LATEST WORKING STRUCTURE
- `/app/products/[slug].tsx` (NOT in a directory)
- Force dynamic on all pages
- No generateStaticParams anywhere

VERCEL MUST USE THE LATEST COMMIT TO WORK!
